# OpenGL Framework

A lightweight C++ framework designed as a foundation for future graphics, engine, and rendering projects.  
This repository provides a clean and modern OpenGL setup using **GLAD**, **GLFW**, **GLM**, and **KHR**, following best practices commonly used in engine development.

## Overview

This project serves as a reusable starting point for OpenGL-based applications.  
It focuses on correct initialization, clean structure, and extensibility, making it suitable for learning, experimentation, and long-term engine development.

The framework handles:
- Window creation
- OpenGL context setup
- Function loading
- Input polling
- Render loop management

## Features

- Modern OpenGL (Core Profile)
- Cross-platform window and input handling via **GLFW**
- OpenGL function loading through **GLAD**
- Mathematics support using **GLM**
- KHR-compliant OpenGL headers
- Keyboard input handling (ESC to exit)
- CMake-based build system
- Clean startup and shutdown lifecycle
