Notes on Coordinate Systems
---------------------------
OpenGL expects all vertices (that we want visible) to be normalized.
This is referred to as normalized device coordinates (NDC).

Some calculations are easier in certain coordinate systems.
There are 5 we should know:
- Local Space or Object Space
- World Space
- View Space or Eye Space
- Clip Space
- Screen Space

To transform coords from one space to the next, we use several
transformation matrices, the most important being:
- Model Matrix
- View Matrix
- Projection Matrix

Model Matrix: Local Space -> World Space
View Matrix: World Space -> View Space
Projection Matrix: View Space -> Clip Space
Viewport Transform: Clip Space -> Screen Space
