Notes on Coordinate Systems
---------------------------
OpenGL expects all vertices (that we want visible) to be normalized.
This is referred to as normalized device coordinates (NDC).

Some calculations are easier in certain coordinate systems.
There are 5 we should know:
- Local Space or Object Space
- World Space
- View Space or Eye Space
- Clip Space
- Screen Space

To transform coords from one space to the next, we use several
transformation matrices, the most important being:
- Model Matrix
- View Matrix
- Projection Matrix

Model Matrix: Local Space -> World Space
View Matrix: World Space -> View Space
Projection Matrix: View Space -> Clip Space
Viewport Transform: Clip Space -> Screen Space

Notes on Transformations
---------------------------
1. Object-local transformations (typical for moving/rotating/scaling) an object in the world:

glm::mat4 model = glm::mat4(1.0f);                  // start identity
model = glm::translate(model, position);            // move the object to world position
model = glm::rotate(model, angle, axis);            // rotate around its origin
model = glm::scale(model, scale);                   // scale the object

- Scaled first, then rotated, then translated

2. rotation around a point other than the origin

glm::mat4 model = glm::mat4(1.0f);
model = glm::translate(model, pivotPoint);
model = glm::rotate(model, angle, axis);
model = glm::translate(model, -pivotPoint);

- Translated to a point, rotated, then translated back
